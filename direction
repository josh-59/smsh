This file exists to give the project some direction. 

1) Hint when unique
    Commands and filename arguments should be hinted when they 
    become uniquely identified.
    To do that, the readline library must categorize each word
    (as command, argument or pipe operator)

    When hinted, tab-complete is enabled;
    Otherwise, tab inserts four spaces.
