Advanced `smsh` Scripting Guide

In this directory are the script examples from Mendel Cooper's excellent Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide, translated to `smsh`.  The purpose of this project is two fold:  1) To prove out the language by demonstrating advanced, real-world examples, and 2) To serve as common-sense documentation of the shell itself.
