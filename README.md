# smsh

Status: Under Initial Development

`smsh` is a shell for the next generation.
It is intended to be full-featured, reasonably fast, and most of all, easy to learn.
It is also intended to be a replacement for Thompson-based shells.
In order to justify that change, `smsh` offers a compellingly better 
scripting language, interactive features unparalleled by current shells,
and respect for the Unix philosophy.
What Rust is to systems programming, `smsh` is intended to be to shells.
