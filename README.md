Simple Shell: A shell for the next generation


`smsh` will be a full-featured, resonably fast, and easy to use shell.
It will respect the Unix philosophy, and offer a readable, even Pythonic, scripting language.
What Rust is to systems programming, `smsh` is intended to be to shells.


As a shell that is simple to understand, 
there are three major concepts to be understood:

    - Pipelines
    - Expansions
    - Conditionals
