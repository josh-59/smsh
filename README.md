# Simple Shell

A shell for the next generation.


## Design Goals

__Simple__  Simple is good. Simple means easy to understand, easy to learn and easy
to master.  Simple also means clean, and `smsh` takes after Python to offer a clean
scripting language.

__Fully Functional__ `smsh` does not compromise with respect to functionality.
It is intended to be capable as a primary shell in both interactive and 
non-interactive capacities.

__Modern Interactive Experience__ Wrapping the simple and capable shell core is
an interactive layer that takes the best-of from current shells and
the Rust ecosystem.


## Project Status

Under initial development.  We're still getting our wheels under us, 
so this project will enter alpha when

- [ ]  While loop implemented
- [ ]  Interactive features become useable
